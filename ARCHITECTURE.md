# Architecture

## Why `packages/shared` is the single source of truth

Every package in this monorepo either produces a piece of Brand JSON or consumes the whole
document — never both a real schema and an ad-hoc parallel shape. `packages/shared` owns the
[Zod](https://zod.dev) schema (`BrandJsonSchema`) and the TypeScript types inferred from it
(`z.infer`). This gives the platform one place to change when the brand model evolves, one
runtime validator at every package boundary, and no drift between what a producer emits and
what a consumer expects.

Concretely: `packages/extractor` and `packages/vision` each produce _partial_ Brand JSON
(colors/typography/tokens from extraction, voice/styleClassification from vision).
`packages/brand-engine` is the only package that assembles a _complete, valid_ `BrandJson` by
merging those partials — see Phase 4 in [Claude.md](./Claude.md). Everything downstream
(`template-engine`, `editor`, `exporters`, `apps/web`) reads that complete document, never a
package-specific shape.

## Dependency graph

```
apps/web
  └─ packages/shared

packages/brand-engine
  └─ packages/shared

packages/template-engine
  └─ packages/shared

packages/exporters
  └─ packages/shared

packages/crawler        (standalone — produces a crawl artifact, not Brand JSON)
packages/extractor       (standalone in Phase 0; will depend on packages/shared once it
                           emits partial Brand JSON in Phase 2)
packages/vision          (standalone in Phase 0; same as extractor, from Phase 3)
packages/editor          (standalone in Phase 0; will depend on packages/template-engine's
                           scene-graph output from Phase 7)
packages/ui              (standalone — no Brand JSON dependency; pure component library)
```

`packages/shared` has no dependencies on any other package in this repo — it sits at the
bottom of the graph by construction. `.dependency-cruiser.cjs` enforces two invariants in CI
(`pnpm check:deps`):

1. **No circular dependencies**, anywhere in the graph.
2. **Nothing under `packages/*` may depend on `apps/web`** — `apps/web` is the top of the
   graph (the product surface), never a dependency of a library package.

## Phase 0 state

As scaffolded, every package/app builds and exports a package-identity constant
(`PACKAGE_NAME`); only `brand-engine`, `template-engine`, `exporters`, and `apps/web` import
from `packages/shared`, since those are the packages whose Phase 0 role already touches Brand
JSON directly. The rest wire up to `packages/shared` as their real logic lands in later phases
(see the per-package README for each package's target phase).
